        <h2>2. Service Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Root is a service marketplace that connects service providers with
          customers. We facilitate this connection by offering a platform for
          users to list, discover, and book services. Root does not provide any
          services directly.

          successfully connecting them with customers through the platform.
          <br />
          This fee is automatically deducted from the service provider's
          earnings.
